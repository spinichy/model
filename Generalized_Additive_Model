set.seed(123)
# Create a piecewise constant signal with different levels
x <- c(rep(0, 25), rep(10, 25), rep(5, 25), rep(-5, 25)) 
# Add Gaussian white noise to the signal
x <- x + rnorm(100) 
windows()
plot(x, main="Original Signal with Noise")

# 2. Perform Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT)
# filter = "haar": Use the simplest wavelet filter (Haar)
# n.levels = 3: Decompose the signal into 3 levels of resolution
wt_result <- dwt(x, filter = "haar", n.levels = 3)

# 3. Visualize the decomposition results
# Shows Approximation (V) and Detail (W) coefficients
plot(wt_result)
